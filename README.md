# Things to know
Hey! I built this project to help narrow down my search for a Jeep because well it seemed like a good idea.  The data is being scraped from two sites and saved to a database. The database is being hosted on Heroku (because well it's free) so it might take a second for the data to load. This project is built using:
- React
- Axios
- React Router Dom
- React Loader Spinner
- Semantic Ui React


You can:
- Add & remove Jeeps from the favorites list
- Search favorites by title and vehicle information
- The Dashboard will inherit the color scheme of system preferences. But may require a refresh & the clearing out local storage since the values aren't saved in the database at this time. 

#Future features
- An indicatior that the Jeep has been saved successfully to favorites
- Tests

Thanks for stopping by!
